        This game was created by the use of Android Studio Application. The things that I used in this code are Text,
        TextField, Column, Row, and some modifier to make my UI to be aligned into the center. As the continuous commit
        in my Github Account, I will update and upgrade my systems features based on the given activity of my professor.
        As for the given activities, the first one was the activities which includes Activities from 1 to 3 that Manipulation
        of Text, Images and Column to design my application. The next Activity was the 4th one which is the Usage of Random
        function and Button in an application. The 5th one was the Interacting with the user and usage of tests in an
        application. The 6th one was the Scrollable List with the use of LazyColumn function, which I used here in
